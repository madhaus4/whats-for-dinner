# What's for Dinner?
## Overview
This project is a dedication to those who need some meal prep inspiration or those who don't know what they want to eat in the moment.  The basic structure displays a food item when a user picks one of three categories: side, main dish, or dessert.

## Build status
This website is a current work in progress with the main feature up and running.  

## Fixes neccessary
- When a user clicks the 'lets cook' button, a food item is generated and displayed in the right box.  If the user is wanting another item and requests one, the initial food option is still shown in the same window.  The function is currently showing a list by compiling random items not replacing them.  

## Future Updates
- Update the fix with a 'clear selection' button that a user will need to click before displaying a differnt food option.
- Add a 'favorites' button so a user cna easily find something they liked again.    

## Built with
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
